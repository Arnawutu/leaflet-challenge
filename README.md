Leaflet Earthquake Map Challenge Project Overview

For this project, my responsibility was to construct an interactive dashboard employing the Leaflet library to present earthquake data sourced from the United States Geological Survey (USGS). The primary objective was to develop a map that displays all earthquakes based on their longitude and latitude coordinates. The markers on the map were required to convey the magnitude of the earthquake through their size and the depth of the earthquake through color variation. Furthermore, the implementation included popups that furnish additional information about each earthquake when the corresponding marker is clicked. A crucial aspect of the task involved creating a legend to provide users with contextual information about the displayed map data.

Technical Proficiency

I applied basic JavaScript skills and leveraged my familiarity with D3.js and Leaflet libraries to execute the project successfully. A fundamental understanding of geoJSON and APIs was essential for effectively working with the USGS GeoJSON Feed data.

Key Project Parameters

The project entailed utilizing the USGS GeoJSON Feed data for mapping earthquakes and visually representing their magnitude and depth. The magnitude was represented through marker size, while the depth was indicated by color variations in the markers. Additionally, I incorporated popups that offer supplementary details about each earthquake upon clicking the corresponding marker. To enhance user comprehension, a legend was crafted to provide contextual information about the displayed map data.

Project Deployment

The finalized project was deployed on a web hosting service, specifically GitHub Pages, accessible through the following link: [Link to the dashboard](https://arnawutu.github.io/leaflet-challenge/)
